      </div>
      <h1>Biosphere Solvency — Concept Note</h1>
      <p class="muted">
        This Concept Note proposes a simple, board-level framing for
        <b>“biosphere solvency”</b> — the capacity of an organisation, portfolio or
        territory to remain <b>solvent, operational and financeable</b> under stress
        from biosphere degradation: soils, water cycles, biodiversity, ecosystem
        productivity, climate–nature feedbacks and other critical ecosystem services.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        The note is <b>independent and purely descriptive</b>. It does not create
        any official standard or label. It suggests a vocabulary and a set of
        questions that boards, supervisors and risk leaders <b>may use</b> to
        structure their internal discussions.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        This text does not describe any product, platform or service.
        It only describes the concept and the underlying domain name
        <b>BiosphereSolvency.com</b>, which may be acquired by a legitimate organisation.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>1. Definition — What is “Biosphere Solvency”?</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        In this note, <b>biosphere solvency</b> refers to the ability of a company,
        financial institution, portfolio or territory to remain solvent and
        financeable when key functions of the biosphere are under stress.
        The emphasis is not on environmental performance as such, but on
        <b>financial soundness and going-concern capacity</b> as ecosystems change.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        For the purposes of board discussions, the biosphere can be understood
        as the ensemble of living systems and supporting cycles that underpin
        economic activity, including for example:
      </p>
      <ul class="muted">
        <li>Soil fertility and agricultural productivity</li>
        <li>Freshwater availability and stability of water cycles</li>
        <li>Biodiversity and ecosystem integrity (terrestrial, freshwater, marine)</li>
        <li>Pollination and other critical ecosystem services</li>
        <li>Forest cover, coastal protection and flood buffering</li>
        <li>Climate–nature feedbacks (e.g. forest dieback, ocean warming and acidification)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        Under a biosphere solvency lens, the central question becomes:
        <b>how sensitive are our cash flows, balance sheet and funding costs
        to shifts in these biosphere functions, over relevant time horizons?</b>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>2. Context and drivers</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Several recent developments have pushed nature and biosphere risks closer
        to the solvency debate:
      </p>
      <ul class="muted">
        <li>
          <b>Nature-related risk frameworks</b> such as the Taskforce on Nature-related
          Financial Disclosures (TNFD) and emerging science-based targets for nature
          encourage organisations to map dependencies and impacts on nature alongside
          climate factors.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Prudential and supervisory discussions</b> increasingly explore how
          physical climate risks, biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation could
          affect credit risk, market risk and insurance underwriting, including via
          supply chain disruptions, asset impairment and higher claims ratios.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Policy and legal developments</b> around deforestation-free supply chains,
          water stress, pollution and restoration can translate biosphere degradation
          into transition risks, stranded assets or rising compliance costs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Macroeconomic and fiscal impacts</b> of ecosystem decline may influence
          sovereign risk profiles, infrastructure resilience and long-term growth
          assumptions, with potential feedback into solvency positions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        In this context, the phrase <b>“Biosphere Solvency”</b> can be used as a
        compact way to signal that the organisation is looking beyond traditional
        ESG metrics and integrating biosphere change into <b>core solvency thinking</b>.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        This note does not endorse any particular framework, standard or dataset.
        It simply recognises that boards may wish to connect ongoing work on
        climate, nature and financial risk under a single solvency-oriented banner.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>3. Possible uses of this framing</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        The term <b>“Biosphere Solvency”</b> can be used in different ways, depending
        on the mandate and ambition of the organisation. Potential applications include:
      </p>

      <h3>3.1 Internal governance and board discussions</h3>
      <ul class="muted">
        <li>Structuring board-level conversations around nature-related solvency risks.</li>
        <li>Clarifying responsibilities between risk, finance, sustainability and strategy teams.</li>
        <li>Setting expectations for management on how biosphere factors should be considered in planning.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3.2 Risk management and stress testing</h3>
      <ul class="muted">
        <li>
          Designing <b>biosphere–solvency stress tests</b> that explore how severe
          ecosystem degradation, water stress or biodiversity loss could alter
          default rates, loss-given-default, claims, investment performance or
          funding spreads.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mapping <b>sectoral and geographical concentrations</b> of exposure to
          biosphere-dependent activities (e.g. agriculture, forestry, fisheries,
          food processing, mining, tourism, infrastructure).
        </li>
        <li>
          Assessing the resilience of collateral values, business models and supply
          chains to plausible biosphere scenarios.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3.3 Strategy, portfolio steering and engagement</h3>
      <ul class="muted">
        <li>
          Identifying business lines, regions or counterparties where biosphere
          trends may materially affect long-term solvency or licence-to-operate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Informing portfolio steering, underwriting strategies, investment mandates
          and capital allocation decisions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Supporting dialogue with clients, investees, supervisors and rating
          agencies on how biosphere issues are incorporated into solvency thinking.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3.4 Disclosures and communication</h3>
      <ul class="muted">
        <li>
          Using the phrase “Biosphere Solvency” as an overarching narrative in
          voluntary publications, investor presentations or nature-related reports,
          where appropriate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Linking existing climate and nature disclosures to solvency-relevant
          metrics and scenarios, without creating new regulatory categories.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="muted">
        In all these cases, the framing <b>could help</b> organisations make explicit
        how biosphere change is considered within their existing risk management
        and solvency processes. It does <b>not</b> prescribe any particular methodology
        or metric set.

      <h2>4. Limitations of this note</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        This Concept Note has several important limitations:
      </p>
      <ul class="muted">
        <li>
          It is <b>not</b> an official standard, taxonomy or supervisory expectation.
          It does not replace laws, regulations, supervisory guidance or accounting rules.
        </li>
        <li>
          It does <b>not</b> define capital requirements, risk weights, provisioning
          rules or any prudential parameters.
        </li>
        <li>
          It does <b>not</b> provide detailed methodologies, data templates or
          implementation roadmaps. Organisations remain responsible for choosing
          appropriate tools, models and expert advice.
        </li>
        <li>
          It does <b>not</b> give assurance on the materiality, time horizon or
          probability of specific biosphere-related risks for any given entity.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        Any organisation considering the integration of biosphere factors into its
        solvency framework should seek its own <b>independent legal, financial,
        scientific and risk expertise</b>, and carefully align with applicable laws
        and supervisory expectations in the relevant jurisdictions.
